    <h2>Air Source Heat Pumps</h2>
    <h4>Basic information:</h4>
    <p>An air-source heat pump can provide efficient heating and cooling for your home. When properly installed, an
        air-source heat pump can deliver up to three times more heat energy to a home than the electrical energy it
        consumes. This is possible because a heat pump transfers heat rather than converting it from a fuel like
        combustion heating systems.
        Air-source heat pumps have been used for many years in nearly all parts of the United States, except in areas
        that experienced extended periods of subfreezing temperatures. However, in recent years, air-source heat pump
        technology has advanced so that it now offers a legitimate space heating alternative in colder regions.</p>

    <h4>Cost:</h4>
    <p>The cost of installing an air source heat pump depends on the size and brand of the unit, as well as the
        difficulty of installation
        any indoor heating equipment that may be needed. The average instillation cost ranges from $4,000 to $8,000.
        Some high-brands may cost up to $12,000.</p>
    <h4>Tax rebate information:</h4>
    <p>Rebates in the form of tax credits are available to home owners that can lower the cost
        of implementing battery storage technology
        up to 30% as outlined below:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Effective for products purchased and installed between January 1, 2023, and December 31, 2032. Can claim
            up to 30% of project cost - $2,000 maximum amount credited.
        </li>

    <h4>Practices:</h4>
    <p>Installing and maintaining renewable air source heat pumps (ASHPs) is essential for homeowners seeking
        energy-efficient heating and cooling solutions. During installation, it's crucial to work with qualified
        professionals to ensure the ASHP is correctly sized and placed for optimal performance. Regular maintenance is
        key to ensuring the system operates efficiently. This includes keeping the outdoor unit clear of debris, such as
        leaves or snow, to maintain proper airflow. Additionally, homeowners should regularly clean or replace air
        filters as recommended by the manufacturer to maintain airflow and indoor air quality. Periodic checks of
        refrigerant levels and electrical connections are also important to ensure the system operates at peak
        efficiency. By following proper installation and maintenance practices, homeowners can maximize the
        energy-saving benefits of renewable ASHPs while enjoying comfortable indoor temperatures year-round.</p>
