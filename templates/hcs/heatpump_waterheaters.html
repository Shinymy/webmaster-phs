    <h2>Heat Pump Water Heaters</h2>
    <h4>Basic Information</h4>
    <p>Heat pump water heaters use electricity to move heat from one place to another instead of generating heat
        directly. Therefore, they can be two to three times more energy efficient than conventional electric resistance
        water heaters.
        To move the heat, heat pumps work like a refrigerator in reverse.
        While a refrigerator pulls heat from inside a box and sends it into the surrounding room, a stand-alone
        air-source heat pump water heater pulls heat from the surrounding air and transfers it -- at a higher
        temperature -- to heat water in a storage tank.

    <h4>Cost:</h4>
    <p>Most homeowners pay around $3,600 to install a heat pump water heater.
        The cost of a heat pump water heater is highly dependent on the efficiency of the system. Size also play a key
        role
        in determining the cost. The following are ranges of prices depending on what size you want:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            40 gallons: Best suited for small homes with one or two people. Costs between $1,200 and $2,000.
            50 gallons: Works well in smaller homes with two to three people. Costs between $1,500 and $2,800.
            65 gallons: Suitable for larger households. Costs between $1,800 and $3,000.
            80 gallons: Ideal for high-demand situations. Costs range from $2,500 to $6,000.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Tax rebate information:</h4>
    <p>Rebates in the form of tax credits are available to home owners that can lower the cost of implementing battery
        storage technology
        up to 30% as outlined below: </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Effective for products purchased and installed between January 1, 2023, and December 31, 2032. Can claim
            up to 30% of project cost - $2,000 maximum amount credited.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Practices:</h4>
    <p>Heat pump water heaters offer homeowners an energy-efficient alternative to traditional electric water heaters.
        During installation, it's important to choose a suitable location with enough space for the unit and proper
        ventilation. Homeowners should also ensure the installation is performed by a qualified professional to
        guarantee safety and optimal performance. Regular maintenance is key to keeping the heat pump water heater
        running efficiently. This includes checking and cleaning the air filters regularly to maintain airflow and
        inspecting the refrigerant lines for leaks. Additionally, homeowners should flush the tank annually to remove
        sediment buildup, which can improve efficiency and prolong the lifespan of the unit. By following proper
        installation and maintenance practices, homeowners can enjoy reliable hot water while reducing energy
        consumption and utility bills with a heat pump water heater.</p>
