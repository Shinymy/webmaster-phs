    <h2>Geothermal Heat Pumps</h2>
    <h4>Basic information:</h4>
    <p>GHPs, also known as ground-source heat pumps, can heat, cool, and supply hot water to homes by transferring heat
        to or from the ground.
        Compared to traditional HVAC units, GHPs are remarkably energy-efficient and can reduce energy bills by up to
        65%.
        They achieve this impressive efficiency by tapping into the Earth’s constant underground temperature, which
        typically ranges from 45°F to 75°F depending on the location.
        There are two different choices when choosing a GHP: A open loop and a closed loop.

    <h4>Cost:</h4>
    <p>A geothermal heat pump installation typically ranges from $15,000 to $35,000, depending on the system size and
        loop type.
        Specifically, the cost per ton installed for a geothermal heating system is $4,000 to $8,000.
        GHPs offer significant savings in operating costs compared to conventional heat pumps, running 25% to 65%
        less. </p>
    <h4>Tax rebate information:</h4>
    <p>Rebates in the form of tax credits are available to homeowners that can lower the cost of implementing battery
        storage technology
        up to 30% as outlined below:
    <ol>
        <li>30% for property placed in service after December 31, 2016, and before January 1, 2020.</li>

        <li>26% for property placed in service after December 31, 2019, and before January 1, 2022.</li>

        <li>30% for property placed in service after December 31, 2021, and before January 1, 2033.</li>

        <li>26% for property placed in service after December 31, 2032, and before January 1, 2034.</li>

        <li>22% for property placed in service after December 31, 2033, and before January 1, 2035.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Practices:</h4>
    <p>Installing and maintaining geothermal heat pumps (GHPs) is vital for homeowners looking for efficient and
        sustainable heating and cooling solutions. During installation, homeowners should consult with experienced
        professionals to assess their property's suitability and determine the most appropriate system design. This
        includes drilling boreholes or laying horizontal loops for the geothermal heat exchange system. Regular
        maintenance is essential to ensure optimal performance and longevity of the GHP system. This includes periodic
        checks of the system's components, such as the compressor, heat exchanger, and circulating pump, to ensure they
        are functioning correctly. Additionally, regular inspections of the underground loop system for any leaks or
        damage are crucial. Homeowners should also schedule professional maintenance visits at least once a year to
        clean and tune the system for peak efficiency. By following proper installation and maintenance procedures,
        homeowners can enjoy reliable and cost-effective heating and cooling with geothermal heat pumps while minimizing
        their environmental footprint.
