    <h1>About this sites creation</h1>
</div>

<div class="container mb-3 mt-3">
    This website was created by authors Edwin and Jacob, who are part of the Pelham High TSA Club. The website is built
    using HTML5,
    CSS3, and some minor JavaScript. Bootstrap 4.x was uses for a majority of the CSS. The skeleton was produced by
    chatGPT as boilerplate code and the rest was coded in a collaborative process using a GIT repository. No other code
    was generated by AI. This website is hosted by netlify and the domain is currently held by Sarah Tarbox.
